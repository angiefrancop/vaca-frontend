# React + Vite


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.


## Official Plugins


Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Configure the environment variables:

  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. For example:

  ```plaintext
  URL_API= URL SERVICES FROM BACK-END
  ```
